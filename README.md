# foodFREQS - Get Your FREQ On!

## Description

The main goal of this project was to use all of our knowledge from module one and two in order to make a full front end and backend app. We decided to make an application for people strongly influenced by the culinary world. Using this application, the user will be able to create a profile, search recipes they want to cook frequently, save them to their profile and interact with other FoodFREQS.

In order to use our application successfully, there are a few steps to take:

1. Login or sign up through the link at the top right corner titled "Login" on the homepage

2. Once you are logged in, click on "Find Your FREQs" in your profile or the homepage to search for recipes!

    a. NOTE: The search query will only take in ingredients that the Edamam API recipes contain

3. Once the results for every related recipe appears, you have the option to add them to your profile for later

4. You can then return to your profile and view the recipes you added or delete them from your profile!
